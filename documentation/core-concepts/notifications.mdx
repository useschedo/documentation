Notifications in Schedo.dev help you stay informed about job failures and system events. The system is designed to keep you updated while avoiding notification fatigue.


Schedo.dev follows a smart notification policy:

- Notifications are sent only for the first failure of a job
- Subsequent failures of the same job won't trigger additional notifications
- This prevents notification spam while ensuring you're aware of issues

```typescript
// Example job that might trigger a notification
schedo.defineJob(
  'daily-report',
  '0 0 * * *',
  async (ctx) => {
    // If this fails, you'll get a notification
    // Subsequent failures won't trigger more notifications
    await generateReport();
  }
);
```

## Notification Management

### Muting Jobs

You can mute notifications for specific jobs:

1. Navigate to the job details page
2. Click the "Mute" button

<img src="/images/notifications/mute-button.jpg" alt="Mute button in job details" />

The job will no longer send notifications for failures

### Email Configuration

Notification emails are sent to a configurable list of recipients:

1. Go to the Settings tab
2. Add or remove recepients

<Info>Important: The email list is shared across all environments in your account. Changes to the list will affect all environments.</Info>
