Jobs are the fundamental building blocks in Schedo.dev. A job represents a task that needs to be executed at specific times or intervals.

# Jobs

## Job Structure

A job in Schedo.dev consists of three main components:

```typescript
schedo.defineJob(
  'unique-job-id',           // Identifier
  '*/15 * * * *',           // Schedule
  async (ctx) => {          // Handler
    // Job implementation
    return 'Job completed';
  }
);
```

### Job Identifier

Every job requires a unique identifier. This ID is used to:
- Track job executions
- Reference the job in the system
- Configure job-specific settings

```typescript
// Good identifiers are descriptive and unique
'daily-cleanup'
'hourly-metrics'
'weekly-report'
```

### Job Context

The job handler receives a context object (`ctx`) containing execution information:

```typescript
async (ctx) => {
  // Execution metadata
  console.log(ctx.executionId);    // Unique execution ID
  console.log(ctx.jobCode);        // Job identifier
  
  // Job metadata
  const metadata = ctx.getMetadata();
  console.log(metadata);
}
```

### Job Return Values

Jobs can return a string that will be stored as the execution result:

<Info>In case your job returns a complex object, it will be serialised to JSON and stored as s string output</Info>

```typescript
async (ctx) => {
  const result = await processData();
  return `Processed ${result.count} items`;
}
```

## Job Lifecycle

Jobs in Schedo.dev follow a simple lifecycle:

1. **Scheduled**: Job is waiting for its next execution time
2. **Running**: Job is currently executing
3. **Completed**: Job finished successfully
4. **Failed**: Job encountered an error

```typescript
schedo.defineJob(
  'example-job',
  '0 * * * *',
  async (ctx) => {
    await processData();
    return 'Job completed successfully';
  }
);
```

## Job Configuration

Jobs can be configured with basic options:

```typescript
schedo.defineJob(
  'configurable-job',
  '0 0 * * *',
  async (ctx) => {
    // Job implementation
  },
  withTimeout(seconds), // optinal execution timeout, default to 5 seconds
  withMetadata({ owner: "analytics-team", priority: "high" }), // optional metadata to be passed to the job
  withBlocking(true), // prevents another job instance from execution in case there is an existing one running
);
```

## Best Practices

While using Schedo SDK, we wrap job handler and track errors under the hood. Whenever your job execution will fail, you will see
an error in the dashboard.

1. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   async (ctx) => {
     throw new Error('Failed to process users')
   }
   ```

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your job statistics and current state:

<img src="/images/jobs/dashboard-overview.png" />
The dashboard shows:
- Total Jobs: Total number of jobs defined
- Active Jobs: Number of jobs that are active and running
- Failed Jobs: Number of job definitions with failed executions

## Job Details

Each job has detailed parameters and execution statistics:

Key information includes:
- Schedule settings
- Job timeout
- Creation date
- Last and next run times
- Execution history graph showing average execution times
