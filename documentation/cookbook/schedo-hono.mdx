description: 'Run scheduled jobs in Hono.JS'
---

Hono.JS is a fast, lightweight, built on Web Standards that support for any JavaScript runtime.
It can be easily integrated with Schedo.dev to give you a way to run your cron jobs as they are the part of a project

<Info>Currently, Schedo.dev can be integrated with Node.JS, Bun, Deno runtimes for Hono. We do not guarantee correct execution for serverless environments at the moment </Info>

## Get started

Let's start with simple Hono.JS application on Node.JS

```typescript
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { Hono } from "hono";

import {
  SchedoSDK,
  ExecutionInterval,
  JobExecutionContext,
  withApiKey,
  withMetadata,
  withTimeout,
} from "@useschedo/node";

const sdk = new SchedoSDK(
  withApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY"),
);


const app = new Hono();

// Here is our internal route for job execution
// We recommend using routes instead of random functions as your Hono context can
app.get("/job-executor", (c) => {
  return c.newResponse("Error happened inside job executor", 500);
});

sdk
  .defineJob(
    "example_hono_job",
    ExecutionInterval.EveryMinute,
    async (ctx: JobExecutionContext) => {
      console.log("Executing job...", ctx.jobCode, ctx.executionId);
      const result = await app.request("/job-executor", {
        body: JSON.stringify(ctx),
      });

      // throwing an error will make this job as failed in Schedo dashboard
      if (result.status >= 500) {
        throw new Error("Error happened: " + (await result.text()));
      }
      return result.text();
    },
    withMetadata({ key: "value" }),
    withTimeout(1000 * 60),
  )
  .then(() => sdk.start());

serve(
  {
    fetch: app.fetch,
    port: 3000,
  },
  async (info) => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${info.port}`);
  },
);

```
