---


Schedo.dev is a modern cloud-based job scheduling platform that solves the common challenges of traditional cron jobs. It provides a reliable, scalable, and developer-friendly way to schedule and manage recurring tasks without the operational overhead.

## Why Schedo.dev?

Traditional cron jobs come with several challenges that make them difficult to use in modern cloud environments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DevOps Complexity" icon="gears">
    Traditional crons require manual configuration through cron files, YAML, or system-level scripts
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Built-in Reliability" icon="shield-xmark">
    Lack of ack/nack mechanisms, retries, and error tracking requires custom implementation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Lock-in" icon="lock">
    Cron logic tied to specific platforms (K8s, EC2) makes migration and scaling difficult
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scaling Issues" icon="chart-line">
    Running on multiple instances requires complex orchestration to prevent duplicates and race conditions
  </Card>
